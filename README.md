# LocationTrackingUsingMapKit

### Location-based services have always looked like a very cool feature to me. Showing the user their covered or targeted location and route made the process of moving around so much better. Here, I will try to implement MapKit, a very simple and easy framework provided by Apple, to work upon with map and location requirements. My aim will be to implement location tracking services and show the covered route on Map View. This will be done using Swift.
